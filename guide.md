# How to setup a Python Twitter bot using PythonAnywhere
1. Start a bash console in the **Consoles** tab.
2. type `mkvirtualenv myvirtual --python/usr/bin/python3.6`
3. Wait until your virtualenv is created, when it's done it'll show up as `(myvirtualenv) $`
4. If everything is set correctly type `which pip` and it should print out `/home/yourusername/.virtualenvs/myvirtualenv/bin/pip`
5. Now install Django and Tweepy by doing `pip install django` & `pip install tweepy`
6. Go to the **Files** tab and you should be at your username's directory. (if it doesn't click on it)
7. Write whatever you want as your new directory name and click new directory.
8. You can upload your files from there (or work on them over there, the end result is the same!)
9. Now click on **Tasks** and create a new task. You'll need to convert your timezone to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
10. In command put `cd /home/yourusername/yourdir/; python main.py` and hit the green checkmark.

You've successfully created a (daily) twitter bot!
(PS. If you want to post a video daily, put `workon myvirtualenv; cd /home/yourusername/yourdir/; python main.py` instead of the one in step 10.
